No standard defined here. Might not even be feasible or make sense depending on deployment (i.e. the RS acting as the client doesn't have access to the bound key)\r\n* binding the token returned from Token Exchange. The request could be MTLS or have a DPoP header, which is kinda implied per standards. And the returned JWT could be bound with the respective `cnf` claim and method, which is maybe implied by standards but not explicitly written down anywhere (that I know of).\r\n* checking the binding on inbound token/assertion of the [Access Token Request](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining-01.html#name-access-token-request). The request could be MTLS or have a DPoP header, which is kinda implied per standards but kinda leaves much to the imagination, and checked against the `cnf` claim of the JWT authz grant. The presence of the `cnf` claim might be sufficient to say the thing is bound and suggest/require checking it (implementations I know about would just ignore it, however). But maybe a new grant type would make sense to clearly convey the intent (also using `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` for a non-bearer thing is awkward). \r\n* binding the resultant access token. The request could be MTLS or have a DPoP header and I think this is covered/implied by the existing specs to say that the issued access token should/could be bound a la [DPoP Access Token Request](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449.html#name-dpop-access-token-request) and [Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica). \r\n\r\nThe [Authorization server acting as client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining-01.html#name-authorization-server-acting) flips around nearly all of the pieces above to make them unworkable. I guess it'd need separate treatment with the definition of something like a proxied \"trust me\" this is the cnf I need in the final access token. IIRC Kelley had some prior work toward this end somewhere but I can't seem to find it at the moment. Or maybe sender constraining is just out of scope in the AS as client proxy case. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The scope can be defined by the client when requesting the access token.\r\n\r\nAs the JWT Authorization Grant profile is designed to allow interop across several domains, each AS in the participating domain will support creating authorization grant JWTs as well as accepting authorization grant JWTs to issue access tokens.\r\n\r\nUsually a client receives an access token alongside the ID Token and the client can use Token Exchange to get additional access tokens with equal or narrowed down scope.\r\n\r\nThe ID Token does not contain any scope. So even if a client only received an Access Token with a specific narrow scope, the client could abuse this grant by asking AS of domain A for an authorization grant JWT based on the Id Token and then use this authz grant JWT at the AS of domain A again to obtain a new access token with arbitrary scope (up to what is allowed for the client as per policy).\r\n\r\nAlthough this could be prohibited by the AS not accepting authorization grant JWTs it issued itself, the client could request the authorization grant JWT from the AS of domain B with just a couple more steps.\r\n\r\nGranted, this may not be relevant for the enterprise environment the JWT authorization grant profile is meant for as the End-User is usually not asked for giving consent to the scope requested by clients and instead the allowed scope in defined by policies within the AS configs. However, I'd like to ask if this is something worth to consider.\r\n",

      "body": "Issue to track email sent to the authors\r\n\r\n> Hello All,\r\nI would like to propose below suggestion for  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining\r\nSection 2.3.1 Token Exchange Request\r\nAs per my understanding the Token exchange request in this proposed RFC will always expect JWT token (urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt) as clearly mentioned in the \u2018section 2.3.4 Example\u2019 with Figure 3: Token exchange response with claim \u2018issued_token_type\u2019 and also mentioned in section 2.4.1 Access Token Request (where only JWT token/assertion is sent to Authorization Server in Domain B as Authorization grant) .\r\nHence my suggestion is to enforce it in the Token exchange request itself (as REQUIRED) parameter by using the \u2018requested_token_type\u2019 parameter of OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange RFC 8693 section 2.1 with value \u2018urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\u2019 as per section 3 of RFC 8693 (OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange). This could prevent the Authorization server in Domain A to respond with another other type of tokens/assertions (like access_token , refresh_token , id_token , saml1 , saml2 as other possible values as per section 3 of RFC 8693 OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange) by mistake or other reasons, which could break this (draft) specification inadvertently.\r\nBest Regards,\r\nRandip Malakar\r\nSTMicroelectronics",

I personally don't see a problem setting it as required, but will my co-authors chime in if they see something I don't.\r\nRegarding the value, yes, \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\" seems the one at hand. Personally, I would also like to discuss to introduce a new type here to be able to differentiate ID chaining from other token exchange use cases on the authorization server. For example something like \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:assertion+jwt\"?\r\nWhat do you think? (@randip and co-authors)\r\n-Arndt",

I was looking at RFC 7523 to see if a token type was defined there that might be more specific that we can use, but you are right, it's a grant type, not a token type. \r\n\r\nReading a bit on, there is section 8 which defines urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer - not a token type, but to be used when presenting the assertion https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523#section-8.2\r\n\r\nSo, it may well be that our best option here is urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt unless we define a new token type. Immediate pros that come to mind is it would be more specific and less overloaded. The con would be that it is a new token type and would delay or impede adoption. I would like to hear from others on whether urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt is a sufficient restriction, or if we need to be more specific. ",

          "body": "In the related issue #86 I'd left [a comment](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-identity-chaining/issues/86#issuecomment-2077999207) with a number of things that'd need to be accounted for or a least considered in adding support for sender constraining to this draft, which I don't believe have been addressed in this PR.  That aforementioned comment copied below for ease of access. \r\n\r\n> A rough sketch of things that likely need to be accounted for or a least considered in this effort:\r\n>\r\n> * checking the binding on inbound token of [Token Exchange](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining-01.html#name-token-exchange) request. No standard defined here. Might not even be feasible or make sense depending on deployment (i.e. the RS acting as the client doesn't have access to the bound key)\r\n> * binding the token returned from Token Exchange. The request could be MTLS or have a DPoP header, which is kinda implied per standards. And the returned JWT could be bound with the respective `cnf` claim and method, which is maybe implied by standards but not explicitly written down anywhere (that I know of).\r\n> * checking the binding on inbound token/assertion of the [Access Token Request](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining-01.html#name-access-token-request). The request could be MTLS or have a DPoP header, which is kinda implied per standards but kinda leaves much to the imagination, and checked against the `cnf` claim of the JWT authz grant. The presence of the `cnf` claim might be sufficient to say the thing is bound and suggest/require checking it (implementations I know about would just ignore it, however). But maybe a new grant type would make sense to clearly convey the intent (also using `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` for a non-bearer thing is awkward). \r\n> * binding the resultant access token. The request could be MTLS or have a DPoP header and I think this is covered/implied by the existing specs to say that the issued access token should/could be bound a la [DPoP Access Token Request](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449.html#name-dpop-access-token-request) and [Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica). \r\n>\r\n> The [Authorization server acting as client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining-01.html#name-authorization-server-acting) flips around nearly all of the pieces above to make them unworkable. I guess it'd need separate treatment with the definition of something like a proxied \"trust me\" this is the cnf I need in the final access token. IIRC Kelley had some prior work toward this end somewhere but I can't seem to find it at the moment. Or maybe sender constraining is just out of scope in the AS as client proxy case. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Aaron's draft that profiles this flow is a good example of other uses, so the RS or AS acting as clients are really two use cases, but the primary task of this draft is to provide a framework for cross domain identity and authorization chaining. Consequently we should describe the generic case where there is an OAuth Client, and then have specific instances such as RS and AS as clients. ",

I think maybe using a detailed flow diagram to convey what's in the draft before having introduced the new ideas is asking it to do too much. I might suggest removing the diagram entirely. Here's some suggested Overview text that doesn't refer to a diagram. I expect its not quite what anyone wants, but it's simpler.\r\n \r\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\nThis document describes how to use OAuth exchanges to effect RS-to-RS requests, where the RSes are subject to separate and independent authorities. No assumption is made regarding the trust relationships between the RSes (or their associated ASes) until certain implementation details are decided. However, in every case the identity of the original requester is carried through to the RS that renders the requested data.\r\n\r\nThe general flow is as follows:\r\n\r\n   o A client requests a resource from an RS in Domain A (RS-A), as in a normal OAuth flow.\r\n\r\n   o To complete the request, RS-A needs data from an RS in Domain B (RS-B). That is, RS-A must act as a Client to RS-B. It must obtain a token to complete this request. \r\n\r\n   o Having obtained a valid token, RS-A requests data from RS-B.\r\n\r\nThe details of the token request in the second bullet will depend on the trust relationship between the two domains. Two cases are summarized here, and presented in detail in appendixes. \r\n\r\n   (1) RSes can request tokens from ASes in multiple domains.\r\n      > RS-A asks AS-A for a token to introduce RS-A to AS-B, and receives one.\r\n      > RS-A presents that token to AS-B, and requests a token with RS-A as requester and RS-B as responder, and receives one.\r\n      > RS-A presents the subsequent token to RS-B and obtains data.\r\n\r\n   (2) RSes can request tokens only from the AS in its own domain.\r\n      > RS-A asks AS-A for a token to access RS-B.\r\n      > AS-A asks AS-B for a token with RS-A as requester and RS-B as responder, and receives one.\r\n      > AS-A returns the subsequent token to RS-A.\r\n      > RS-A presents the subsequent token to RS-B and obtains data.\r\n\r\nThe following sections define the tokens, grants, and claims to acheive this flow. Proper understanding and implementation of this document depends on familiarity with OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] and JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7523] etc etc.\r\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=",

          "body": "> A picture may paint a thousand words, but it can be challenging to make a single picture paint the same thousand words for everyone. I think maybe using a detailed flow diagram to convey what's in the draft before having introduced the new ideas is asking it to do too much. I might suggest removing the diagram entirely. Here's some suggested Overview text that doesn't refer to a diagram. I expect its not quite what anyone wants, but it's simpler.\r\n> \r\n> =-=-=-=-=-=-= This document describes how to use OAuth exchanges to effect RS-to-RS requests, where the RSes are subject to separate and independent authorities. No assumption is made regarding the trust relationships between the RSes (or their associated ASes) until certain implementation details are decided. However, in every case the identity of the original requester is carried through to the RS that renders the requested data.\r\n> \r\n> The general flow is as follows:\r\n> \r\n> o A client requests a resource from an RS in Domain A (RS-A), as in a normal OAuth flow.\r\n> \r\n> o To complete the request, RS-A needs data from an RS in Domain B (RS-B). That is, RS-A must act as a Client to RS-B. It must obtain a token to complete this request.\r\n> \r\n> o Having obtained a valid token, RS-A requests data from RS-B.\r\n> \r\n> The details of the token request in the second bullet will depend on the trust relationship between the two domains. Two cases are summarized here, and presented in detail in appendixes.\r\n> \r\n> (1) RSes can request tokens from ASes in multiple domains. > RS-A asks AS-A for a token to introduce RS-A to AS-B, and receives one. > RS-A presents that token to AS-B, and requests a token with RS-A as requester and RS-B as responder, and receives one. > RS-A presents the subsequent token to RS-B and obtains data.\r\n> \r\n> (2) RSes can request tokens only from the AS in its own domain. > RS-A asks AS-A for a token to access RS-B. > AS-A asks AS-B for a token with RS-A as requester and RS-B as responder, and receives one. > AS-A returns the subsequent token to RS-A. > RS-A presents the subsequent token to RS-B and obtains data.\r\n> \r\n> The following sections define the tokens, grants, and claims to acheive this flow. Proper understanding and implementation of this document depends on familiarity with OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] and JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7523] etc etc. =-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\n\r\nI also like the idea of removing Figure 1 in the Overview section. To get it right is too complicated to begin the doc so just leave the steps (A) - (F) in text and point to the appendix for specific use cases (RS as client, AS as client)",

The normative section of the draft describes the interaction between a client in domain A, accessing a resource server in domain B. The current Figure 1 already describes this flow.\r\n\r\nThe non-normative appendix describes use cases where a resources server in Domain A needs to access a resource server in Domain B. There are two variants - with the RS in domain A accessing the AS in domain B directly, and the AS in domain A acting as proxy for all clients (including the RS) in domain A. We have diagrams to explain those flows, and we should make changes to those diagrams to highlight any peculiarities of the those use cases. \r\n\r\n",
